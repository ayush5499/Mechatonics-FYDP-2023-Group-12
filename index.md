# Background

All around the globe, waste segregation is an integral factor in maintaining a sustainable environment. Since the natural resources of the world are depleting rapidly, the world population including everyday households, are relying heavily on recyclable materials. As the utilization of recyclable materials increases, the volume of recyclable materials disposed from each household also increases. To ease the responsibilities of recycling contractors, every individual should ideally be mindful of their respective waste disposal practices.  
 
After conversing with multiple contractors and conducting several surveys with numerous stakeholders, the team analyzed that the most difficult part for the recycling and waste disposal industry is to segregate the waste into their respective categories. As most people are still unaware about the division and disposal of their waste, most of the waste ends up in the same bin which in turn end up in landfills or oceans. 

The main issue that general population faces are to determine the different categories that different type of waste segregates into. This problem is faced at the root level and to combat with the waste contamination, the best way is to handle them at the root level itself. More importantly, there exist a need to build a system that autonomously assists individuals in segregation of waste into their respective bins. Furthermore, this system can be installed on multiple bins present in public areas, universities, mall and so on.


# Our Product

The team had to come up with a system that assists everyone in properly disposing of the waste and therefore prevents waste contamination. The system had to be modular, so that it can be installed on already existing bins. It also needed to work offline with minimum power consumption, having low cost and build out of strong materials. This is because, the system is going to be installed in public places. Most importantly, the main objective of the system is to have minimum physical contact with each individual and to detect the waste category within 1 seconds.

The team would love to introduce you the computer vision aided garbage disposal system, that would help each person to scan their waste and tell them what receptacle each part is going to be disposed of. The best part about it is that you don’t even have to touch anything so that no germs can be transferred.  

# Working of the Product

_Here is how the product will work:_
* The user scans the product by bringing it Infront of the Camera
*	The camera then clicks multiple images of the product itself, at the same time maintaining everyone’s privacy
*	Once the images are clicked, a vision aided machine learning script gets triggered
*	The script analyses all the images and detects the waste categories
*	After the waste types are detected, the user can now see the instructions on how to properly dispose of the waste
*	Simultaneously, all the receptacles that the waste would go into, will have their flaps open, therefore, if the user in a hurry, even without seeing the instructions, he/she knows where waste would go into
*	The whole process last only for 1 second and there is no contact between the user and the bin
*	The system is further integrated with the plant operations, so they can keep a tract of the amount of waste being disposed
